//! Chip and pill geometry: the optical rules the 0.4.0 feel review found

//!
//! Rasters are how a reader judges a pill, but bounds are how a test can.
//! These measure what the reader is reacting to: whether a pill sizes to
//! its own label, whether the space left of the text matches the space
//! right of it, and whether the lifecycle dot sits on the label's centre
//! line rather than near it.
